My [interview with Andreas Mueller](https://mlconf.com/interview-andreas-muller-lecturer-columbia-university-core-contributor-scikit-learn-reshama-shaikh/), who is the core contributor to the Python Scikit-learn library, was conducted right before our first [WiMLDS Scikit Sprint](https://github.com/WiMLDS/scikit-sprint) to involve more women in open source contribution.  It is posted on MLConf's website.
