> Even in today's world, many women still have mixed feelings about admitting their ambitions openly, and don't want to be seen as blatantly power-seeking.  At the same time, research suggests that when women do get power, good things happen.  For instance, companies with women on the senior leadership team tend to perform better, and women tend to have more of the skills people associate with effective leaders.  In this panel, powerful women will share how they've navigated their way to the top -- and show you how to embrace your ambition and follow in their footsteps.

### Tips
- Can get things done if people respect you.
  - When you are good [at your job], people afford you a lot of liberties to do what you want.
- Own your space.  That says a lot about you and your confidence.
- Don't be afraid.  If something is not appropriate, don't accept it.
  - Cue into when people are being condescending.

- Hard work isn't enough. You have to take care of yourself.
  - No one looks out for you, but you.

- Hard work and results are important.
- Women tend to listen better.
- Don't be afraid if you are the only woman.  Your gift is that you are memorable.
- Swim like a duck.  Turn up strong, freak out later.  
- We are all guilty of some unconscious biases.  
- **Power**:  is how do you achieve things that are most important to you.
  - Feminine power can be quite strong.  
  - desire to have control over yourself
  - "I want to control my schedule."
